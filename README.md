Its Pretty simple to swap the hair selections for the baldness as the code has comments they should be setup for most servers 

drag and drop the qb-hathair folder into your standalone resource folder and restart the server if needed then type /hathair and it will remove your hair 

It didn't take long to code so there may be bugs 

i seen people selling similar scripts for $10 enjoy

it should be known that if you leave the server after using the hathair you will come in bald as long as you re use the command you should be find
